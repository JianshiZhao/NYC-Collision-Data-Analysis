##Analyze NYC Collision Data under Different Weather Conditions

Climate Change and global warming have been a cental tipic of the problems we are facing these years. 
Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change. 
One consequence of the recent climate change is the increase of extreme weather conditions, and these 
in turn will affect our lives. In this project, I would like to investigate some correlation between bad weather
and motor viehcle collisions to get some insigt of how weather affected the accidents, what can we learn to 
save lifes from accidents in the future.
